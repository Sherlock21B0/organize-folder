# Organize folder
Our Downloads folder are usually **BIG** and **MeSsY**, wouldn't it be nice to have all files separated in subfolders like text, dmg, exe, pdf, photo, videos.
This software organizes the Downloads folder (or any folder) by moving files in separate easy to find folders. 


>Tip: It will be pretty handy to create shortcut to run program in Linux/MacOS
 ```bash
 $ alias organize="path/to/organize.py"
 ```

 >Run:
 ```bash
 # organize Downloads folder
 $ organize
 $ organize ~/Downloads
 # organize any folder by providing path
 $ organize path/to/folder
 ```

 > *Recommended python version > 3.7*
